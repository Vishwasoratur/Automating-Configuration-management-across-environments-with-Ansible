# Automating Configuration Management Across Environments with Ansible

This repository contains an Ansible-based solution for automating configuration management across multiple environments (Development, Staging, and Production). It simplifies the deployment and management of configurations, ensuring consistency and reducing manual effort.

---

## Key Features

1. **Environment-Specific Configurations:**
   - Separate inventory files for Development, Staging, and Production.
   - Customizable variables to adapt to different environments.

2. **Role-Based Structure:**
   - Modular design using Ansible roles for scalability and maintainability.
   - Roles for tasks like installing packages, configuring services, and managing files.

3. **Dynamic Templates:**
   - Template files (`.j2`) for environment-specific configurations (e.g., Nginx, application settings).
   - Variables for dynamic substitution.

4. **Idempotent Tasks:**
   - Tasks ensure no unintended changes are applied if re-run.

5. **Extensibility:**
   - Easily add new roles or modify existing ones to meet evolving requirements.

6. **Automated Deployment:**
   - Deploy and configure services like Nginx with a single command.
   - Ensure services are running and enabled across environments.

## Technology Stack

- **Ansible**: For automation and orchestration.
- **Ubuntu**: As the target operating system.
- **Nginx**: Example service for deployment and configuration.

---

## How It Works

1. **Define Inventory:**
   - Inventory files (`inventories/dev`, `inventories/staging`, `inventories/prod`) specify target servers and environment-specific variables.

2. **Run Playbooks:**
   - Playbooks use roles and templates to configure servers.

3. **Deploy Services:**
   - Includes an example for deploying and configuring Nginx but can be extended to other services.

4. **Manage Consistency:**
   - Ensures configurations are consistent across environments.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   cd ansible-project
   ```

2. Update inventory files with your server details.

3. Customize variables in `group_vars` or `host_vars`.

4. Run the playbook for the desired environment:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventories/dev playbooks/site.yml
   ```
